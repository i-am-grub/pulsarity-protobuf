# Pulsarity Protocol Buffers

This repo contains the definition files for the protocol buffers
used by the Pulsarity application and any companion software that
integrates with it over its various communication interfaces
(http, websocket, etc). The definitation files can be used to 
generate the implementation files for any programming language 
that supports protobufs.
